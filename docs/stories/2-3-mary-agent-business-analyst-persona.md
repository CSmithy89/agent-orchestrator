# Story 2.3: Mary Agent - Business Analyst Persona

Status: review

## Story

As the orchestrator core,
I want a Mary agent that excels at requirements analysis,
So that PRD workflows can extract and structure user requirements intelligently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Load Mary persona from bmad/bmm/agents/mary.md
2. Configure with project-assigned LLM from `.bmad/project-config.yaml` agent_assignments (supports Anthropic, OpenAI, Zhipu, Google providers)
3. Specialized prompts for: requirement extraction, user story writing, scope negotiation
4. Context includes: user input, product brief (if exists), domain knowledge
5. Methods: analyzeRequirements(), defineSuccessCriteria(), negotiateScope()
6. Generate clear, structured requirements documentation
7. Make decisions with confidence scoring via DecisionEngine
8. Escalate ambiguous or critical product decisions

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Alignment

**MaryAgent Location**: `backend/src/core/agents/mary-agent.ts`

Per architecture.md and tech-spec-epic-2.md:
- Mary is a Business Analyst persona agent in the Autonomous Intelligence layer
- Specialized in requirements analysis, user story writing, scope negotiation
- Collaborates with John (Product Manager agent, Story 2.4) via shared workflow context
- Uses DecisionEngine (Story 2.1) for confidence-based decision making
- Escalates ambiguous decisions via EscalationQueue (Story 2.2) when confidence < 0.75
- Configured with project-assigned LLM from `.bmad/project-config.yaml`

**MaryAgent Methods** (from tech spec lines 254-292):
```typescript
interface MaryAgent {
  analyzeRequirements(
    userInput: string,
    productBrief?: string
  ): Promise<{
    requirements: string[];
    successCriteria: string[];
    assumptions: string[];
  }>;

  defineSuccessCriteria(features: string[]): Promise<string[]>;

  negotiateScope(
    requirements: string[],
    constraints: Record<string, any>
  ): Promise<{
    mvpScope: string[];
    growthFeatures: string[];
  }>;
}
```

**Agent Persona Schema** (from tech spec lines 142-154):
```typescript
interface AgentPersona {
  name: string;                  // "Mary"
  role: string;                  // "Business Analyst"
  provider: string;              // e.g., "anthropic", "openai", "zhipu"
  model: string;                 // e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-5", "gpt-4", "GLM-4.6"
  temperature: number;           // e.g., 0.3 for reasoning
  systemPrompt: string;          // Persona definition from mary.md
  specializedPrompts: {
    [method: string]: string;    // e.g., analyzeRequirements: "..."
  };
}
```

**PRD Workflow Integration** (from tech spec lines 346-353):
```
User Input
    ↓
  Mary (analyze requirements)
    ↓
Requirements Draft
    ↓
  John (validate & prioritize)
    ↓
Strategic Feedback
    ↓
  Mary (refine requirements)
    ↓
Final Requirements → PRD Template
```

**Mary's Decision Points** (uses DecisionEngine):
- Unclear requirement scope → Escalate if confidence < 0.75
- Ambiguous acceptance criteria → Escalate if confidence < 0.75
- MVP feature boundary → Autonomous (Mary decides with confidence scoring)
- Success metric definition → Autonomous (Mary defines with John validation)

### Learnings from Previous Story

**From Story 2.2 (Status: done)**

- **EscalationQueue Integration**: EscalationQueue class implemented and ready
  - Located at `backend/src/core/services/escalation-queue.ts`
  - Mary should call `EscalationQueue.add()` when confidence < 0.75
  - Integration pattern: DecisionEngine checks confidence → If < 0.75 → EscalationQueue.add() → Workflow pauses
  - [Source: stories/2-2-escalation-queue-system.md#Dev-Agent-Record]

- **DecisionEngine Integration**: DecisionEngine implemented in Story 2.1
  - Located at `backend/src/core/services/decision-engine.ts`
  - ESCALATION_THRESHOLD = 0.75 is fixed
  - Mary should wrap ambiguous decisions with `DecisionEngine.attemptAutonomousDecision()`
  - Decision returns: { question, decision, confidence, reasoning, source, timestamp, context }
  - Two-tier decision: onboarding docs (0.95) → LLM reasoning (0.3-0.9) → escalation (<0.75)

- **File Structure Pattern**: Agents go in `backend/src/core/agents/`
  - DecisionEngine at `backend/src/core/services/decision-engine.ts`
  - EscalationQueue at `backend/src/core/services/escalation-queue.ts`
  - Mary should follow: `backend/src/core/agents/mary-agent.ts`
  - Persona file expected at `bmad/bmm/agents/mary.md` (to be created in this story)

- **Testing Patterns**: Use vitest with established patterns from Epic 1
  - Unit tests at `backend/tests/core/agents/MaryAgent.test.ts`
  - Integration tests at `backend/tests/integration/mary-agent.test.ts`
  - Mock LLMFactory for deterministic LLM responses
  - Mock DecisionEngine for confidence scoring tests
  - Target >80% coverage for agent code

- **Dependencies Available**:
  - LLMFactory from Epic 1 (Story 1.3) - creates LLM clients for any provider
  - AgentPool from Epic 1 (Story 1.4) - manages agent lifecycle
  - DecisionEngine from Story 2.1 - confidence-based autonomous decisions
  - EscalationQueue from Story 2.2 - human intervention when confidence < 0.75
  - RetryHandler from Epic 1 (Story 1.10) - retry LLM failures with exponential backoff
  - Logger from Epic 1 - consistent logging format

- **Multi-Provider Support**: LLMFactory supports multiple providers
  - Anthropic: Claude Sonnet (recommended for Mary - strong reasoning)
  - OpenAI: GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4
  - Zhipu: GLM-4, GLM-4.6 (via native or z.ai wrapper)
  - Google: Gemini (optional, may not be implemented yet)
  - Configuration in `.bmad/project-config.yaml` under agent_assignments

**Key Takeaways for Story 2.3**:
- Mary extends base agent pattern (if exists) or implements core agent interface
- Load persona from `bmad/bmm/agents/mary.md` (markdown file)
- Use LLMFactory to create LLM client based on project config
- Wrap ambiguous decisions with DecisionEngine (confidence scoring)
- Escalate when confidence < 0.75 via EscalationQueue
- Test with multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Zhipu)
- Follow ATDD: Write tests first (Task 8), then implement (Tasks 1-7)
- Mary will collaborate with John (Story 2.4) via shared workflow context

### Development Approach (ATDD)

**This story follows Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD):**

1. **Write Tests First** (Red Phase)
   - Start with Task 8 (Unit tests) before implementing code
   - Write failing tests for each acceptance criterion
   - Create test file: `backend/tests/core/agents/MaryAgent.test.ts`
   - Organize tests by AC (one describe block per AC or method)
   - All tests should fail initially (no implementation yet)

2. **Implement Minimum Code** (Green Phase)
   - Create `backend/src/core/agents/mary-agent.ts`
   - Create `bmad/bmm/agents/mary.md` (persona definition)
   - Implement just enough code to make tests pass
   - Follow Tasks 1-7 in order
   - Run tests frequently: `npm run test:watch`
   - Ensure each AC's tests pass before moving to next AC

3. **Refactor** (Refactor Phase)
   - Clean up code while keeping tests green
   - Extract duplicate logic, improve naming
   - Ensure performance targets met (<30s per method call)
   - Maintain >80% coverage: `npm run test:coverage`

4. **Integration Tests** (Task 9)
   - Write integration tests after unit tests pass
   - Test Mary → DecisionEngine → EscalationQueue flow
   - Test Mary collaboration with John (Story 2.4, will be ready after Story 2.4 done)
   - Create `backend/tests/integration/mary-agent.test.ts`

**Test-First Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Write tests (should fail)
npm run test -- MaryAgent.test.ts

# 2. Implement code (make tests pass)
npm run test:watch

# 3. Check coverage (target >80%)
npm run test:coverage

# 4. Refactor and verify tests still pass
npm run test
```

**Benefits of ATDD for this story:**
- Ensures all 8 ACs are testable and verified
- Catches integration issues with DecisionEngine/EscalationQueue early
- Validates LLM response parsing works correctly
- Confirms performance targets (<30s) are met
- Prevents regressions during refactoring
- Enables confident multi-provider testing (Anthropic, OpenAI, Zhipu)

### Linting & Code Quality

**Before committing any code, run all quality checks:**

```bash
# 1. Type checking (must pass, no errors)
npm run type-check

# 2. ESLint (must pass, no errors or warnings)
npm run lint

# 3. Auto-fix lint issues (if possible)
npm run lint -- --fix

# 4. Run all tests (must pass, 0 failures)
npm run test

# 5. Check coverage (>80% for MaryAgent)
npm run test:coverage
```

**Code Quality Standards:**
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, no `any` types (use `unknown` if needed)
- **ESLint**: Follow project rules, disable rules only with justification comments
- **Naming**:
  - Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `MaryAgent`)
  - Methods: camelCase (e.g., `analyzeRequirements`)
  - Interfaces: PascalCase (e.g., `AnalysisResult`)
  - Files: kebab-case (e.g., `mary-agent.ts`)
- **Comments**: JSDoc for public methods, inline comments for complex logic
- **Imports**: ESM syntax (`import`/`export`), explicit `.js` extensions in imports
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with specific error types, helpful error messages

**Pre-commit Checklist:**
- [ ] All tests passing (unit + integration)
- [ ] Coverage >80% for new code
- [ ] TypeScript type-check passes
- [ ] ESLint passes with no warnings
- [ ] No console.log (use Logger from Epic 1)
- [ ] JSDoc comments on all public methods
- [ ] Persona file (mary.md) created with complete prompts
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns from Story 2.1/2.2

**Git Commit Message Format:**
```
Story 2.3: Brief description of changes

- Bullet point of what was implemented
- Reference AC numbers (e.g., AC #1, #2)
- Note any architectural decisions
- Mention test coverage achieved
```

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer**: Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
**Date**: 2025-11-07
**Outcome**: **CHANGES REQUESTED**

### Summary

Story 2.3 implements the Mary Agent (Business Analyst persona) following ATDD approach with excellent technical implementation. All 8 acceptance criteria are fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage (40+ unit tests, 25+ integration tests).

**However**, critical documentation/tracking issues must be addressed:
1. ALL tasks marked incomplete `[ ]` despite being fully implemented
2. Story status "drafted" instead of "review"
3. Dev Agent Record was incomplete (now populated)
4. Tests not executed to verify they pass

### Key Findings (by severity)

#### HIGH SEVERITY 🔴

1. **Tasks Falsely Marked Incomplete**
   - **Finding**: All 9 tasks (lines 26-164) marked `[ ]` but ALL are fully implemented
   - **Evidence**: Files exist and contain complete implementations
   - **Action Required**: Mark all implemented tasks as `[x]`

2. **Story Status Incorrect**
   - **Finding**: Status is "drafted" (line 3) instead of "review"
   - **Action Required**: Update to "review" or "done"

3. **Tests Not Executed**
   - **Finding**: Cannot verify tests pass (dependency errors in environment)
   - **Action Required**: Run test suite and verify >80% coverage

#### MEDIUM SEVERITY 🟡

4. **TypeScript/ESLint Not Verified**
   - **Finding**: Linting not executed due to dependency issues
   - **Action Required**: Run type-check and lint

5. **John Agent Integration Pending**
   - **Note**: Expected - Story 2.4 not yet implemented
   - **Action**: Complete in Story 2.4

#### LOW SEVERITY 🟢

6. **Persona File Could Include Examples** (Optional)
7. **Hard-Coded Persona Path** (Minor - works correctly)

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC# | Description | Status | Evidence |

| Task 9 | Integration tests | `[ ]` | ✅ COMPLETE | `mary-agent.test.ts:1-550+` |

**Summary**: **9 of 9** tasks verified complete, **9 falsely marked incomplete**.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Unit Tests** (`MaryAgent.test.ts`):
- 40+ test cases covering all 8 ACs
- Proper mocking (LLMFactory, DecisionEngine, EscalationQueue)

- Error handling tests

**Integration Tests** (`mary-agent.test.ts`):
- 25+ test cases
- Multi-provider support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Zhipu)
- DecisionEngine + EscalationQueue flows
- Performance and output quality validation

**Gaps**:
- ❌ Cannot verify tests pass (dependencies not installed)
- ⚠️ John agent collaboration (pending Story 2.4)

### Architectural Alignment

✅ **Compliant** with Epic 2 Tech Spec (lines 254-292, 748-761)
✅ **Compliant** with Architecture Document
✅ **No architecture violations**

**Integrations**:
- ✅ LLMFactory (Epic 1, Story 1.3)
- ✅ DecisionEngine (Story 2.1)
- ✅ EscalationQueue (Story 2.2)
- ✅ RetryHandler pattern (Epic 1, Story 1.10)

### Security Notes

✅ **No security issues found**
- Input validation present
- Type safety via TypeScript strict mode
- Descriptive error messages without leaking internals
- No hard-coded secrets

**Advisory Notes**:
- Consider JSON schema validation for LLM responses (production hardening)
- Consider input length limits to prevent abuse

### Best-Practices and References

✅ **All best practices followed**:
- TypeScript strict mode, ESM modules, JSDoc
- ATDD approach (tests first)
- Proper async/await, error handling, retry logic
- Structured logging, clear interfaces

### Action Items

**Code Changes Required**:

- [ ] **[High]** Mark ALL 9 tasks as `[x]` completed in story file (lines 26-164)
- [ ] **[High]** Update story Status from "drafted" to "review" (line 3)
- [ ] **[Medium]** Run test suite and verify >80% coverage:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm run test -- MaryAgent.test.ts
  npm run test -- mary-agent.test.ts
  npm run test:coverage
  ```
- [ ] **[Medium]** Run TypeScript type-check and ESLint:
  ```bash
  npm run type-check
  npm run lint
  ```
- [ ] **[Medium]** Add Change Log entry with date 2025-11-07

**Advisory Notes**:

- Note: Consider JSON schema validation for LLM responses (production)
- Note: Consider input length limits for userInput (optional)
- Note: Mary+John collaboration tests will be completed in Story 2.4
- Note: Persona file could include example JSON outputs (optional enhancement)

### Verdict

**Technical Implementation**: EXCELLENT ⭐
**Documentation/Tracking**: NEEDS FIXES 🔴

Once HIGH severity items addressed (mark tasks complete, update status, run tests), Story 2.3 is ready for **DONE**.
