# Stories Directory

This directory contains active user story files for the current sprint/epic.

## Structure

Story files follow the naming convention: `{epic-number}-{story-number}-{story-slug}.md`

Example:
- `2-1-confidence-based-decision-engine.md` (Epic 2, Story 1)
- `2-2-escalation-queue-system.md` (Epic 2, Story 2)

## Story Context Files

Each story may have an associated context file: `{story-name}.context.xml`

These context files are generated by the `story-context` workflow and contain:
- Relevant code snippets
- Architecture decisions
- Dependencies
- Related documentation

## Story Lifecycle

1. **Drafted**: Story file created by Product Manager/Scrum Master
2. **Ready for dev**: Story context generated, ready for implementation
3. **In progress**: Developer actively working
4. **Review**: Code review in progress
5. **Done**: Story completed, tested, and merged

## Archival

When an epic is completed:
- All story files are moved to `/docs/archive/epic-{number}-stories/`

- Stories directory is cleared for next epic
