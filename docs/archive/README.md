## Why Archive?

Documentation is archived when:
1. **Stories are completed**: Story files move to archive after epic completion
2. **Documents are superseded**: Early designs replaced by current specs
3. **Historical value only**: Reports and artifacts that informed decisions but are no longer actively referenced

Archived documentation remains accessible for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding project evolution
- Retrospective analysis
- Audit trails
