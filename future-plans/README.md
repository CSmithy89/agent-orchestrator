## 🎯 What is the Business Hub Platform?

An AI-powered platform where:

1. **Users provide business ideas** → AI validates market, creates business plan, builds brand
2. **AI creates products** → Courses, podcasts, books, YouTube channels, digital/physical products
3. **AI operates the business** → Content creation, marketing, analytics (24/7 automation)
4. **Humans approve key decisions** → Strategic control points ensure quality

**Value Proposition:**
- Turn ideas into revenue-generating businesses in < 30 days
- 90% automation (< 5 hours/week human time)
- Uses user's own AI subscriptions (Claude, Codex, Gemini)
- Platform fee: $49-499/month (vs $5K-11K/month traditional approach)

## 🏗 Architecture Highlights

### Unified Agno Orchestration
- **Single framework** coordinates all AI agents
- **Multi-LLM support** (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, ZAI, local models)
- **Sequential BUILD phase** (Validation → Planning → Branding → Product)
- **Parallel OPERATE phase** (Content, Marketing, Analytics running simultaneously)

### Key Technologies
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma, BullMQ
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Redis
- **AI:** Agno + Claude Code SDK + OpenAI + Gemini
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP

### BMAD Module System
Reusable business logic modules:
- **Core:** BMV (Validation), BMP (Planning), BMB (Branding), BMI (Intelligence)
- **Products:** BME-Course, BME-Podcast, BME-Book, BME-YouTube, BME-Physical, etc.
- **Operations:** BMC (Content), BMX (Marketing), BMS (Sales), BMO (Operations), BMT (Analytics)

## 📅 Implementation Timeline

**20 weeks to beta launch:**

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Database + API + First Module
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Core modules + Build workflows
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Agno integration + Multi-agent + Operate workflows
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16):** Complete UI/UX
- **Phase 5 (Weeks 17-20):** Testing + Deployment + Beta Launch

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Development Teams:
